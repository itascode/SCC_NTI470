What have you completed since the last report?

Today, I got some work with my employer about documentation and construct a diagram for an internal
network. I got some especifations about the equipment for the document and I started doing research about the processs
of integration of VM from Blade Centers

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I hope to have a better perspective of the project with more information about the process
and I will start designing and documenting. Also, I expect that my supervisor send me some 
of the documentation to start creating the diagram of the network

What is getting in your way?

I have to do many research about the best technology that the college can use for the project,
and I have to wait for my supervisor information to start working in the diagrams. it might be delayed it by that
