Student Name: Cody Antonio Gagnon
Status Report # 4
Date: 04-18-18

What have you completed since the last report?

I've communicated with multiple people to learn more about what will be required
to get EAD integration into Accucampus. We also took and created a database which
contains separate timeline, card, and task views of what we plan on doing for the
rest of the quarter; we used http://coda.io to accomplish this task.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report we'll have scheduled a survey appointment and began generating
statistics and planning out our report for district to hear our EAD appeal.

What is getting in your way?

This EAD issue will probably get in our way for awhile, but we did see that
another Seattle Central app was able to get EAD support, so we're hoping for the best.
My dream would be for students to easily login to Accucampus so that they can access
the services it offers.
