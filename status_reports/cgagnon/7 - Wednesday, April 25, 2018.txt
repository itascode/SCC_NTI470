Student Name: Cody Antonio Gagnon
Status Report # 7
Date: 04-25-18

What have you completed since the last report?

There's been some correspondence which is resulting in a large meeting including those
members associated with Accucampus who're able to help us. We have also made correspondence
on surveying and this will buoy our ability to receive feedback from students in the coming
week. We are making some headway on getting data from students about their technology wants
and I feel like we're also one step closer to getting Accucampus to work more for the students.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report I'll have met with my supervisors and finalized survey plans as
well as revisiting what our goals are for the rest of the quarter. We are hoping to
be able to gain insight into students' technology wants as well as figuring out how
Accucampus is going to meet those needs in the real world.

What is getting in your way?

I am preparing to have a meeting with many people for the first time in my life. I
feel like preparing for such an event is going to be the most important thing, so I'd
say that anything which could hamper my ability to prepare would be getting in my way.
