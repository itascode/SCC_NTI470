Status Report # 2

What have you completed since the last report?

Yesterday we had a meeting to discuss a survey which was conducted by student leadership
to see students' response to features that would make the advising process easier for them.
This survey was particularly made for International Programs after the surveyor and multiple students
complained about long wait-times to do simple tasks like scheduling appointment. While we didn't get to
see the survey itself, I learned a lot about what our survey would provide in addition
to the  process of students' experience using Accucampus.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report I plan to respond to any emails that come back from others which I've sent
emails to. I also plan to look into SSO, or Single Sign On solutions which Accucampus can leverage to
allow students to login with their EAD passwords. This process will take time to understand and research
will be required to do so.

What is getting in your way?

Getting a response back might prove to be an issue. The current way which I believe
students need to access Accucampus is unintuitive and inefficient at best. We need
to address the way that login portal is hampering students' ability to get the functionality
out of the app that they need. This will require a lot of research and communication
to implement correctly, and we're still unsure of who we will talk to in order to
get the ball rolling.
