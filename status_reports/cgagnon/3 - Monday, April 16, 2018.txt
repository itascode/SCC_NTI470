What have you completed since the last report?

I have been working on researching how to actually implement Accucampus at advising
by doing job shadowing as well as researching how to fix a major user experience issue.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report I will have emailed relevant parties to understand more about ITs'
role in implementing Accucampus at Seattle Central.

What is getting in your way?

Finding who's worked on the Accucampus at Seattle Central is taking more time than
expected. I haven't been able to locate the specific person that did the SIS, or
Student Information System imports into Accucampus, but really that's the main issue.
