Student Name: Cody Antonio Gagnon
Status Report # 5
Date: 04-20-18

What have you completed since the last report?

I've emailed and received replies from faculty and Accucampus staff. From faculty
I'll be be receiving help in constructing a survey from one of Central's librarians.
I'd also received a message confirming that Accucampus can utilize SSO, or Single
Sign On to authenticate users with EAD.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report I'll have attempted to coordinate more meetings with faculty,
and further researched information we can use to build our case for integrating EAD
into Accucampus.

What is getting in your way?

I am concerned about how to best present this issue from the student perspective
in hopes this issue will be resolved. Being able to find who the right people to
talk to about our issue had proved to be an obstacle; but now that I believe we've
been able to find some people who can assist with this issue, I'm hopeful that we'll
be able to get this issue resolved.
