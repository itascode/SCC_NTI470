What have you completed since the last report?

This is my first report. Since this time I've met with advising to discuss
sending out a survey to students to see what technologies they'd want to be
integrated into advising.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report I will have met with a fellow in Student Leadership to
check up on a survey which he's performed by advising.

What is getting in your way?

Right now thinking about how to implement Accucampus and getting information
is kinda confusing. I'm hoping that I'll be able to meet with others to get
insight into how it's configured at Seattle Central.
