Student Name: Cody Antonio Gagnon
Status Report # 6
Date: 04-23-18

What have you completed since the last report?

Since the last report, I've been in contact with more faculty members in addition
to doing some research into the testing of Outlook integration with Accucampus. So
far we've learned that we'll need to ensure that IT has provisioned all advising
computers (probably all computers on the image) with the software executable required
for this functionality.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report I hope to actually have some testing of Outlook synchronization
done in addition to having a mostly completed survey to send out to students. We also
want to develop a better idea of what students are able to do with Accucampus to Build
our case for SSO; we hope that our emails to faculty will supplement us with information
to make an informed decision about our next steps with regards to this.

What is getting in your way?

Probably being able to use the Outlook integration will be an obstacle, but we
just don't know yet. This issue will take testing on our part as well as asking
faculty and observing their use-case to understand where the issues will arise; but
if we're unable to actually use the software executable on the computers that will get
in our way first.
